## Technical Implementation Details

### Required Contract Addresses (Sepolia)

```typescript
export const CONTRACTS = {
  FACTORY_ADDRESS: "0x...", // Need actual deployed address
  CHAIN_ID: 11155111, // Sepolia
} as const;
```

### Bundle Size Optimization Strategy

- Tree-shake wagmi/RainbowKit imports
- Dynamic import heavy components
- Optimize shadcn/ui imports
- Use Next.js Image optimization
- **Target**: <500KB initial bundle

### Performance Requirements

- **First Contentful Paint**: <1.5s
- **Time to Interactive**: <3s
- **Bundle Size**: <500KB
- **API Response**: <100ms
- **Database Queries**: Optimized with indexes

### Responsive Design Targets

- **Mobile**: 375px - 768px
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px
- **Desktop**: 1024px+
- **Large**: 1440px+

## Success Metrics

### Functional Requirements

- ✅ Connect wallet and deploy tokens in <30 seconds
- ✅ Real-time vesting progress updates
- ✅ Batch operations support 100+ beneficiaries
- ✅ Mobile-responsive interface

### Technical Requirements

- ✅ <500KB JavaScript bundle size
- ✅ <100ms database query response times
